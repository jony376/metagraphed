# Floating branch, not a pinned commit SHA -- deliberate: this job's whole
# purpose is staying current with registry/subnets/*.json (contributor PRs
# land on main continuously) as well as any code fixes, so pinning would
# defeat that and require manual re-pinning on every deploy. main already
# requires review + CI + the Gittensory Gate before anything lands, the
# same trust level every other box job implicitly extends to this repo.
# (A security review flagged the unpinned clone given this same container
# later holds CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN in the economics step -- considered, not
# overlooked; see the atomic-clone fix just below for the finding that WAS
# worth fixing from that same review.)

# security review correctly pointed out that this breaks the stated trust
# boundary between the snapshot step (untrusted, no secrets) and the
# economics step (holds CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN): a malicious postinstall/
# preinstall/prepare script from any of ~600 npm packages, running during
# the SNAPSHOT step's npm ci, could plant or modify a file the ECONOMICS
# step later executes with the real token in scope. --ignore-scripts closes
# the install-time-arbitrary-code vector (this repo's own package.json has
# no lifecycle scripts of its own, confirmed); the git diff check below is
# defense in depth against anything that still wrote to the tracked source
# tree some other way.
